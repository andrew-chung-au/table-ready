# Blueprints

What a project using this kit should have, when each piece applies, and how to create it for the folder it's in. Setup (`setup.md`) works through this list; so does any later review. The templates are starting points: adapt every placeholder to the project, never copy one in unchanged.

## Rules for every blueprint

- **Build on what exists.** Merge into existing files; never replace or delete them. When an existing file does the same job as a blueprint, adapt the blueprint to it, or propose moving the old one to `_docs/archive/`. The human decides.
- **Only when it applies.** Each blueprint has a trigger. If it hasn't happened yet, record the blueprint as "later", not "not needed".
- **Propose first.** Show every new file or change as a diff, and create nothing until the human approves.
- **Don't loosen a gate to make existing code pass.** If existing code fails a new check, leave that check off in `agent-kit.conf` and propose an issue to fix the code.

## Notes on specific blueprints

**Project instructions.** Fill the project half from what the folder actually contains; write "none" for command slots the project doesn't have yet. Keep the shared Conventions block unchanged. Carry useful content from any existing instruction file into the project half, and say where each part went. In a monorepo, include the line that limits work to this folder. Leave nested instruction files that other tools generated (for example `frontend/AGENTS.md`) in place, and check they don't contradict the root file.

**Kit settings.** Set `TEST_CMD` to the test target. Adjust `TEST_FILES` to the project's test layout and `FORBIDDEN` to its secrets and generated files. Keep `PROTECTED` covering at least `AGENTS.md`, `agent-kit.conf`, the spec and the kit folder.

**Make targets.** Wrap the project's existing commands; don't introduce new tools. Add missing targets to an existing Makefile, and never rename or replace existing ones. Add a `## description` comment after each existing target's name so `make help` lists it. When a target is added, the Commands section of `AGENTS.md` gets the matching slot.

**Start and stop targets.** Agents trigger approval prompts, and risk stopping the wrong process, when they start a server with `&` and stop it with `pgrep` and `kill`. A target pair keeps the process ID and log in `.scratch/`, refuses to start a second copy, and stops only the process it started. Name the pair after the process, for example `responder-start` and `responder-stop`, and add both to the Commands section of `AGENTS.md`. Keep the project's foreground target (such as `make run`) for humans.

**Stub setting for external processes.** Tests and smoke checks shouldn't start a real AI agent or call a paid service. When the code starts one, it gets a setting that swaps in a stub (for example `RESPONDER_AGENT_CMD`), and the tests use it. Real runs stay a manual, deliberate step.

**Known environment issues.** When the same environment problem comes back, the human shouldn't have to work it out again from an approval prompt. Add one entry per problem to the project README, proposed at the decision point:

```
### Grafana can't reach Prometheus (codespaces)
- Symptom: data source errors in Grafana; the 5xx alert never fires.
- Check: docker network inspect order-tracker_default -f '{{range .IPAM.Config}}{{.Subnet}}{{end}}'
- Fix (human): sudo iptables-legacy -I DOCKER-USER -s <subnet> -d <subnet> -j ACCEPT
- Undo: sudo iptables-legacy -D DOCKER-USER -s <subnet> -d <subnet> -j ACCEPT
- Lasts until: the codespace restarts, or the stack's network is recreated with a new subnet. Re-run the check after `make run`.
```

Agents then cite the entry in their approval request instead of rediscovering the fix.

**Lint and type-check gates.** Order matters: add the targets, fix or suppress the existing errors (as an issue, through the normal process), and only then set `LINT_CMD`/`TYPECHECK_CMD`. Setting them earlier would block every push on errors nobody introduced.

**Git hooks.** Hooks are repository-wide, so they live at the repo root even when the project is a subfolder. They only act on folders containing `agent-kit.conf`, so other folders are unaffected. Once installed, git ignores `.git/hooks`, so `install-hooks.sh` checks what's there first. Standard Git LFS hooks are replaced automatically: the kit installs LFS pass-throughs, and its `pre-push` uploads LFS objects after verify passes. Any other existing hook stops the install until the human merges it or approves `FORCE=1`. The `.githooks/` folder is committed once, and each clone or new codespace runs `make hooks` once.

**Ignore rules.** Make sure the project's `.gitignore` contains these lines, in this order, so `.env.example` stays tracked:

```
.env
.env.*
!.env.example
.scratch/
```

Add local databases, and build, cache and dependency folders for the stack. Check the result with `git check-ignore .env.example`, which should print nothing (without `-v`; with it, git also prints the `!.env.example` line that un-ignores the file). The pre-commit hook catches these files too, but ignore rules keep them out of `git status`.

**Session summaries.** If the project already has summaries with a naming scheme, keep that scheme and record it in the **Session summaries** setting in `AGENTS.md`.

**CI backstop.** In a monorepo, the workflow must sit in `.github/workflows/` at the repo root, with a `paths:` filter for the project folder. A `.github/` folder inside a project folder is ignored by GitHub. Fill in the stack setup steps from the project's tooling.

## Tool pointers

Many AI coding tools read `AGENTS.md` directly. For a tool that reads its own file instead, add a short pointer file so every tool gets the same instructions. Check the tool's documentation for its file name and import syntax. For example:

- **Claude Code** reads `CLAUDE.md`, which can import other files. The Claude Code layer installs it from `claude-code/CLAUDE.md.template`: `@AGENTS.md`, then a line pointing temporary files at `.scratch/`, because Claude Code's default scratchpad is outside the project folder and triggers approval prompts.
- **Other tools:** a pointer file that says "Follow the instructions in AGENTS.md", if the tool can't import files.

Create pointer files only for tools the human actually uses.

## Tool permissions

Tools that ask before running commands can usually pre-approve safe ones. Allowing the project's `make` targets, read-only git commands (`git status`, `git diff`, `git log`) and scripts in `.scratch/` (`python3 .scratch/…`, `bash .scratch/…`) removes most routine prompts, while pushes and edits to protected files still ask. Only propose this for a tool the human uses, and show the settings change for approval. For Claude Code, the layer's `claude-code/settings.json` already holds these rules.

Never allow-list `git push` or commits with `HUMAN_APPROVED=1`. The prompt before an approved commit is the human's last check that what's staged is what they approved.

Allow rules don't help with commands the tool can't analyse (shell variables, heredocs, chains, paths outside the folder). Those still ask whatever the allow rules say, so the only fix is the agent writing simpler commands, as the Conventions in `AGENTS.md` describe.

In a monorepo, tools that restrict reads to the project folder will ask each time a kit review reads the repo-root `.githooks/`. Add that one folder to the tool's allowed directories, not the whole repo root. In Claude Code, that's `/add-dir <repo root>/.githooks` for one session, or `permissions.additionalDirectories` in `.claude/settings.local.json` to keep it.

## Role definitions

Some tools let a project define named subagents. The orchestrator can then launch "the QA engineer" instead of a general-purpose agent that has to be told, in each launch message, to read the project's instructions. Each definition is a short pointer, so the role files in `_docs/agent-kit/team/` stay the single source of truth.

For Claude Code, the layer provides all three in `claude-code/agents/`; see `claude-code/START.md`. For another tool, write the same short pointer in that tool's format: "Read `AGENTS.md`, then `_docs/agent-kit/team/<role>.md`, and follow both. If something needs the human's approval, return the request to the orchestrator instead of running it." Protect the definitions in `agent-kit.conf`, because they decide what each role is told, and create them only for tools the human uses.

## Commit attribution

Mark AI-assisted commits with one plain line naming the tool, for example "Generated with Claude Code". Leave out co-author lines with an email address and model versions: the address may not be one you'd choose, and both go stale.

In Claude Code, the layer's `settings.json` already includes this block. To apply it to every project instead, put it in the human's user settings:

```json
{
  "attribution": {
    "commit": "Generated with Claude Code",
    "pr": "",
    "sessionUrl": false
  }
}
```

`"pr": ""` adds nothing to pull request descriptions, and `"sessionUrl": false` leaves out the session link. For other tools, check their documentation for an equivalent setting, and create it only for tools the human uses.
