Read `AGENTS.md`, then `_docs/agent-kit/team/pm.md`, and follow both. Use your built-in tools to read and search files. Write only to `.scratch/`, for example issue text before you post it, and put multi-step checks in `.scratch/` scripts. If something needs the human's approval, return the request to the orchestrator instead of running it.
